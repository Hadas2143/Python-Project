# Python-Project
We’ve all been there: after typing numerous lines of text, we glance at the screen only to discover a devastating mistake—everything was typed in the wrong language because the keyboard was set to English instead of our intended layout. 

Time wasted. Effort lost.

That’s why we set out to create the ultimate solution. 

This project aims to bring convenience and efficiency to your typing experience, ensuring you never have to deal with this frustration again.
