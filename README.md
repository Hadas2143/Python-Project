We’ve all been there: after typing numerous lines of text, we glance at the screen only to discover a devastating mistake—everything was typed in the wrong language because the keyboard was set to English instead of our intended layout. 😒

Time wasted. Effort lost.

That’s why we set out to create the ultimate solution. 💯

This project aims to bring convenience and efficiency to your typing experience, ensuring you never have to deal with this frustration again.
